# Mining-Correlated-High-Utility-Itemsets-in-One-Phase

Conducted research on the topic of 'Mining Correlated High Utility Itemsets in One Phase' and subsequently re-implemented the methodology. This involved exploring techniques for efficiently identifying itemsets with high utility values and uncovering correlations among them in a single phase.
